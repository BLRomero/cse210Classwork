Me vs. You | Tom MacDonald | 225 | 3 |
@MrSquadup2 | I would normally share this with my mother but she passed this past Monday 6/10. She would be in her hospital bed and for entertainment I’d send her your videos when they dropped. She absolutely loved your music and was thankful someone was speaking up for the regular people before she passed. Much love Tom. | 
@johnb2832 | Love the symbology of him playing both roles and the narrator, only him represents all one America and we are fighting ourselves.
@georgetoivo7092 |As a 62 year old retiredAs a 62 year old retired Marine and a devout 80s rocker, your music is absolutely on point. And to think you are doing this all on your own. You are a force to be reckoned with. Carry on my friend and keep the faith. We will get through this shit one way or another. Semper Fi.|

@tanahaines1043 |WOW! I am a 64 year old lady, probably not the demographic you are aiming for, but I'm in love with your patriotism and spirit! I get discouraged when I look at the desecration of our beautiful country. Sometimes it seems patriotism has died. Then, there you are! Thank you|
@lulufune1489 | My mom being Canadian who became a American Citizen, as did her whole family. I was taught only to RESPECT The American Flag. Thank You for this. It boggles my mind how people disrespect the greatest symbol to have ever been made. Do they not know what Freedom is? |
